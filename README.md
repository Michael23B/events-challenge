# events-challenge

Build a small web application that helps users browse and discover events that they might be interested in. Leverage the Ticketmaster event discovery API (https://developer.ticketmaster.com/api-explorer/).

Feel free to use any framework, platform or delivery mechanism you wish to help you achieve your desired outcome.

The only requirements for the assignment are:

    We can filter by location
    We can provide a start and end datetime.
    Your code is well-tested.
    The README.md has been update with instructions to build and run your code.

Feel free to tackle this problem in a way that demonstrates your expertise of an area -- or takes you out of your comfort zone.

Good luck!
